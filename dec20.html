        <p>Psalm 138 and Psalm 139 address the fear and self doubt that often plague me. Maybe you share some of the same fears.</p>
        <p>One fear that troubles me now and undermines me is the fear that I am unlovable to anyone who truly knows me, both my "good" and "bad" parts. How human is that feeling?! Even my little grandson wishes to present only his best side to his grandparents. That desire starts so young in a human being. Fear of my darkness being known, leading to rejection by those whose regard I value so much. Psalm 139 helps me deal with that fear. It reminds me that: <em class="bible">"Lord, thou hast examined me and knowest me...Thou hast kept close guard before me and behind and hast spread Thy hand over me. Such knowledge is beyond my understanding."</em> But I am so grateful for it.</p>
        <p>A related fear, a common one, is fear of the dark, both in the physical sense and spiritual. My grandson shares that fear, so we make sure he has a flashlight with him at bedtime. But what about the darkness within? Psalm 139 tells me that: <em class="bible">&ldquo;If I say surely darkness will steal over me, night will close around me, darkness is no darkness for Thee...Both dark and light are one.&rdquo;</em> God's love is bigger than my darkness. Psalm 138 says: <em class="bible">&ldquo;I will praise thee, O Lord, with all my heart.&rdquo;</em> Like the psalmist, I too am full of thankfulness for God's love, which is beyond my understanding.</p>
