            A voice says cry out.<br>
            What shall I cry?<br>
            What shall I cry when my faith is a faint bulb<br>
            in a large, cold room?<br>
            Well, it isn't all dark I suppose.<br>
            It could be colder, and it isn't.<br>
            This is not a stirring cry.<br>
            <br>
            A voice says cry out.<br>
            What, Voice? What shall I cry?<br>
            My faith is an ice skate in a closet box,<br>
            and I have not considered it like this since last year.<br>
            It's seasonal, but nice. It's nice to have.<br>
            This is not a proclamation.<br>
            <br>
            We are so close to Christmas<br>
            and even now, I am no heavenly host before shepherds.<br>
            I am no crier of news, no bringer of joy.<br>
            I am the shepherds themselves, hurrying from their nighttime fields,<br>
            finding the family,<br>
            peering into the manger.<br>
            <br>
            I am the sheep themselves,<br>
            shrugging fleecy shoulders.<br>
            What shall we cry?<br>
            What shall we cry?<br>
            Until the shepherd pulls us in,<br>
            carries us close, warms us,<br>
            lights up even the largest, coldest room.<br>
