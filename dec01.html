        <p>During my recent hospitalization, my nurse confided in me that he was still struggling with anger issues. I could sympathize with him, body and mind, because I too have struggled not so long ago with anger issues of my own. Psalms 4 and 7 on the first Monday in Advent deal, among other things, with the human issue of anger in a way more pleasing to God than other possible reactions. The people of the Old Testament were as human as we are, dealing with many of the same issues.</p>
        <p>Psalm 4 tells us, <em class="bible">"However angry your hearts, not do wrong. Though you lie abed resentful, do not break silence. Pay your due of sacrifice and trust in the Lord."</em> Easier said than done is my immediate reaction! And I don't think I am alone in feeling that way. The first impulse is often to strike back at the offender, such as my little grandson striking the street curb he stumbled on, or someone yelling at the offender. There is the use of humor and imagery, like my friend wanting to mount a machine gun on her car to take care of traffic problems, a very human impulse I think we all can understand.</p>
        <p>What about anger at self? That can be harder to deal with. Anger against self can take the form of depression with self harm physically or emotionally. Containing anger takes a lot of energy. Psalm 7 reminds us that: <em class="bible">"If I have stained my hands in guilt. If I have repaid a friend evil for good, God the High God is my shield. O Lord, in thee I find my refuge; God is a just God."</em> I might add also a loving and forgiving God. Praise be his name!</p>
